	<h1>Mobile Application Testing</h1>
	<p>Mobile application development is far more complex than development for standardized PCs or servers. There are many vendor specific APIs, proprietary kernels and operating systems, different screen sizes and MMIs. Furthermore, many mobile applications are to be deployed on hundreds of different mobile phones or devices, increasingly over the air! We have an outstanding track record on testing mobile applications running on all kinds of mobile phones, PDAs, and other embedded devices.</p>
