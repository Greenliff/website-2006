		<h1>Test Engineering</h1>
		<p>In many cases, testing requirements go far beyond the features of an off-the-shelf testing tool. Specialized test suites covering the mission-critical business logic and IT environment are required. We have the extensive software development know-how and the experts to specify, design, develop and maintain such test cases and test tools.</p>

	 <div class="spalte2">
		<h1>Test Automation</h1>
		<p>With the right technologies and methods, automated software testing is a cost efficient strategy. Furthermore, automated tests are the basis for efficient regression testing. An automated test framework can run thousands of tests every night and as part of a continuous integration strategy can provide a daily overview of product quality as well as up-to-the minute assessments of software development changes.</p>
