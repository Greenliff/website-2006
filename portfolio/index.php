		<h2>How do we work?</h2>
		<p>Our consultancy includes coaching and guidance in all software testing activities. We are technology independent and tool agnostic. We develop concepts and solutions, but we like to participate in the implementation too. We identify critical test data, develop test plans, select appropriate tools, execute tests, define and produce test reports, analyze results and recommend any necessary corrections.<br />
		Everything <em>including the know-how</em> is given to you as part of our service.</p>
