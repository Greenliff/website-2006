          <h1>ISTQB&#174; Certified Tester Foundation Level</h1>

          <p>The seminar provides a comprehensive overview of the tasks, methods and techniques used in software testing. You will be introduced to all the steps of the software testing process, from planning and specification to carrying out and logging tests. </p>
          
          <p>On completion of the course you will be familiar with the essential terminology of testing and the relevant international norms and standards. You will be able to successfully apply techniques such as equivalence partitioning at the module, integration or system test level. You will understand how meaningful error reports are created, how the defect correction process is monitored, and how efficient error re-testing is carried out. You will know which test tools can support your work, and you will be familiar with the pitfalls involved in selecting and introducing these tools. </p> 
          
          <p>You will be well prepared to earn the ISTQB&#174; Certified Tester Foundation Level certificate, as this seminar is accredited according to the  syllabus and extensively explains the terms, definitions and test practices you need to know.</p> 
          
          <p>During the course, your new knowledge will be reinforced by case studies and practical work. Participants are able to sit the certification examination at the training location on the last day of the course.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to the four-day version, this seminar is also available as a three day intense training at your own location. The intense version of the course still covers the syllabus of the ISTQB&#174;, but is abbreviated and offers less room for discussion and practical aspects.</p>
